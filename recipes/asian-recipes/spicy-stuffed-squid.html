            <li>In small bowl combine the rice, raisins and pine nuts.</li>
            <li>Saute 1 chopped onion and 3 cloves garlic with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium skillet. Cook until soft. Add the chopped squid tentacles, and the rice mixture. Stir well and remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet saute the onion and 4 cloves garlic until soft. Stir in the red pepper flakes and oregano. Add the tomatoes with juice, anchovy paste and wine. Stir and cook over medium heat until slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stuff the squid with the rice mixture and seal ends with wooden picks. Place squid in the prepared baking dish. Pour tomato sauce over all and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour.</li>
